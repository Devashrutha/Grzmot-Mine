# Grzmot-Mine
Introduction:

Grzmot is a nonlethal explosive mine. It's used to gain more information about the enemy's location during a siege. Imagine a hostage needs rescuing, but the position within the house is unknown. As a sentinel, you would want to cover your back from an ambush. The Grzmot mine has your back! It detects the heat radiated from humans in the infrared spectrum of light within a specific range. A short concussive burst from an explosive will disorientate the enemy and reveal his location. This mine can be attached to any surface during entry.This project is inspired by a game called 'Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege'

 The above figure shows the basic block diagram of the Grzmot mine. 
 
ðŸ”ºThe Infrared Radiation(IR) from any human will be detected by the Passive Infrared(PIR) sensor.

ðŸ”ºA pair of pyroelectric sensors beside each other pick up the radiation.

ðŸ”ºWhen the signal differential between the two sensors changes (when a person comes in range), the sensor will activate.

ðŸ”ºThis high signal is fed to the input of the NE555 timer circuit, which determines how long the ignition source must be on.

Working:

The NE555 time is configured in monostable mode.
